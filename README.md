# UFOs

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to create a website with a dynamic table that displays the filtered UFO sightings info. With this project, we want to provide users with the option of filtering the data using different parameters than just the year. The table will have additional filters such as city, state, world, and element geometry.

Resources
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, HTML/CSS, JavaScript. 
- Data Source: UFO data -  ufo_starterCode.js and index.html

## Results

The results are shown in the new structure of the website.


The new website offers the flexibility to filter the information located in the main table by using the new search fields with additional options such as city, state, country, and shape.
