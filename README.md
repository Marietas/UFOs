# UFOs

## Overview of the project

This project aims to create a website with a dynamic table that displays the filtered UFO sightings info. With this project, we want to provide users with the option of filtering the data using different parameters than just the year. The table will have additional filters such as city, state, world, and element geometry.

Resources
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.54.2, HTML/CSS, JavaScript. 
- Data Source: UFO data -  [ufo_starterCode.js](https://github.com/Marietas/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) and [index.html](https://github.com/Marietas/UFOs/blob/main/index.html).

## Results

The results are shown in the new structure of the website.

The new website offers the flexibility to filter the information located in the main table by using the new search fields with additional options such as city, state, country, and shape. 

## Summary

The new website has a powerful tool to provide a more efficient and insightful description of UFO sightings in the United States. However,  there are some issues that could impact the quality and the performance of the webpage. 

- One of the most significant challenges is that the table is static and doesnâ€™t have a live feed to add real-time-data.  As a result, every single update needs to be adjusted manually by changing the code. Our recommendation is to implement a live data feature to resolve this roadblock. 

- In addition to this, we suggest cleaning up the data first, especially the comments section, to enhance the user experience by facilitating the use of keywords.
